### Structure

The page is divided into three main sections:

1. **Header Section**:
    - Displays the user's name, avatar, and a brief description about their profession and interests.
  
2. **Links Section**:
    - Contains clickable social media links (Telegram, Instagram, GitHub), each represented by an icon and text.
  
3. **Portfolio Section**:
    - Contains a description of the user's programming skills and background in a "About Me" section.

### How to Use

1. **Customization**:
   - Replace the placeholder text in the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements with your personal information.
   - Update the links in the `<a>` tags to point to your actual social media profiles and GitHub repository.

2. **Adding New Links**:
   - To add more links to your profile, copy and paste one of the `<a>` tags in the links section and update the `href` attribute and the icon class accordingly.

3. **Styling**:
   - The page is responsive, meaning it adjusts for different screen sizes. Modify the `max-width` value or other CSS properties as needed to match your desired layout.
